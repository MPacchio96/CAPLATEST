# Business Logic Overview

## Data Section

### Overview
This part of the project focuses on processing and preparing data that will be used in other parts of the project. Data is a key element for analysis and decision-making, so it's important to load, process, and store it correctly.

### Detailed Steps and Code Explanation

Data Loading:

⚠️ **NOTE: This step is not used in our solution as we are working with generated data. The process starts directly with Step 2, and all necessary data is automatically generated for demonstration purposes.**

Goal: Obtain data from various sources, such as CSV files or databases, and load them into the program for further processing.

1. **Data Loading**:
   - **Goal**: Obtain data from various sources, such as CSV files or databases, and load them into the program for further processing.
   - **Technologies Used**: The `pandas` library is key for manipulating data frames. It allows easy loading of data from various formats like CSV, Excel, SQL databases, etc.
   - **Process**:
     - Data is loaded into data frames (`DataFrame`), which is a table-like structure that allows efficient manipulation and analysis of data.
     - Example code for loading data from CSV:
       ```python
       import pandas as pd
       data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
       ```
     - This step is important for obtaining raw data that will be further processed.

2. **Data Generation**:
   - **Goal**: Create synthetic datasets for testing using the `Faker` library and random distributions.
   - **Technologies Used**: `Faker` for generating realistic data and `numpy` for numerical operations.
   - **Process**:
     - Generation of datasets that contain intentional errors for testing.
     - Example code for generating data:
       ```python
       from faker import Faker
       fake = Faker()
       emails = [fake.email() for _ in range(100)]
       ```
     - This step enables testing with realistic but controlled data.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Goal**: Clean data from missing or inconsistent values that could affect analysis.
   - **Technologies Used**: Again `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - **Process**:
     - Removal of duplicate records that could skew analysis results.
     - Filling missing values using various strategies such as mean, median, or specific value.
     - Converting data types to ensure values are consistent and suitable for analysis.
     - Example code for removing duplicates:
       ```python
       data = data.drop_duplicates()
       ```
     - This step ensures that data is in a consistent and usable format.

4. **Data Consistency Check**:
   - **Goal**: Validate email addresses, check for missing and negative values, and ensure order average value consistency.
   - **Technologies Used**: `pandas` for data analysis.
   - **Process**:
     - Email address validation using regular expressions.
     - Checking and removing records with missing or negative values.
     - Example code for email validation:
       ```python
       invalid_emails = df[~df['email'].str.contains(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$', regex=True)]
       ```
     - This step ensures that data is clean and consistent.

5. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Goal**: Prepare data in a format suitable for analysis, which may include normalization, scaling, or category encoding.
   - **Technologies Used**: `pandas` and `numpy` for numerical operations.
   - **Process**:
     - Data normalization to ensure uniform scale, which is important for algorithms sensitive to data scale.
     - Data scaling to remove differences in value ranges.
     - Category encoding, which means converting text values to numerical ones for use in machine learning algorithms.
     - Example code for normalization:
       ```python
       from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
       scaler = StandardScaler()
       data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data)
       ```
     - This step ensures that data is ready for further analysis and modeling.

6. **Data Storage**:
   - **Goal**: Store prepared data for further use in the project.
   - **Technologies Used**: `pandas` for exporting data to various formats.
   - **Process**:
     - Data can be stored in memory for immediate use or exported to files for later loading.
     - Example code for saving data to CSV:
       ```python
       data.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
       ```
     - This step ensures that data is available for other parts of the project.

### Used Libraries
- **`pandas`**: Main library for data frame manipulation. Enables efficient loading, cleaning, transformation, and storage of data.
- **`numpy`**: Used for numerical operations and array manipulation, which is useful in data transformation.

## Clustering Section

### Overview
This part of the project focuses on data segmentation using clustering. The goal is to divide data into groups (clusters) that have similar properties, enabling better analysis and targeting.

### Detailed Steps and Code Explanation

1. **Clustering Metrics Calculation**:
   - **Goal**: Calculate metrics such as inertia and silhouette score for various k values (number of clusters) to help determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - **Technologies Used**: The `scikit-learn` library is key for calculating these metrics. It provides implementations of clustering algorithms and cluster quality evaluation.
   - **Process**:
     - **Inertia**: Measures how well data is grouped within clusters. Lower inertia value means better grouping.
     - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how well data is separated between clusters. Higher value means better separation.
     - Example code for calculating inertia and silhouette score:
       ```python
       from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
       from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

       inertia_values = []
       silhouette_scores = []

       for k in range(2, 11):
           kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
           kmeans.fit(data)
           inertia_values.append(kmeans.inertia_)
           silhouette_scores.append(silhouette_score(data, kmeans.labels_))
       ```
     - This step is important for determining the optimal number of clusters.

2. **AI Analysis**:
   - **Goal**: Use OpenAI to analyze metrics and recommend optimal number of clusters.
   - **Technologies Used**: OpenAI API is used for metric analysis and providing recommendations.
   - **Process**:
     - Creating a prompt for OpenAI that contains calculated metrics and analysis requirements.
     - Getting recommendations from OpenAI, including optimal number of clusters and reasoning.
     - Example prompt for OpenAI:
       ```
       Analyze these clustering metrics and recommend the optimal number of clusters (k):

       Inertia values (k=1 to k=10):
       [inertia values]

       Silhouette scores (k=2 to k=10):
       [silhouette values]

       Requirements:
       1. Consider both the elbow method (inertia) and silhouette scores
       2. The minimum number of clusters must be 3
       3. Explain the trade-off between number of clusters and model complexity
       4. Recommend a specific k or a narrow range (max 2 numbers)
       ```
     - This step ensures that optimal number of clusters is selected based on objective metrics and AI analysis.

3. **Cluster Creation**:
   - **Goal**: Divide data into recommended number of clusters using K-means algorithm.
   - **Technologies Used**: `scikit-learn` for K-means algorithm implementation.
   - **Process**:
     - Initialization and training of K-means model with optimal number of clusters.
     - Assignment of data points to individual clusters.
     - Example code for creating clusters:
       ```python
       kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_k, random_state=42)
       cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(data)
       ```
     - This step ensures that data is effectively divided into groups with similar properties.

4. **Cluster Validation**:
   - **Goal**: Verify quality of created clusters using visualizations and AI analysis.
   - **Technologies Used**: `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data and metrics visualization.
   - **Process**:
     - Creation of visualizations such as Elbow graph and Silhouette graph to show cluster quality.
     - Using OpenAI for further analysis and evaluation of cluster quality.
     - Example code for visualization:
       ```python
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

       plt.plot(range(2, 11), inertia_values, 'bx-')
       plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters (k)')
       plt.ylabel('Inertia')
       plt.title('Elbow Method')
       plt.show()
       ```
     - This step ensures that created clusters are quality and usable for further analysis.
